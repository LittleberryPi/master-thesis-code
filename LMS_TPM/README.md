# Secure state handling of LMS
This repository is an extension of the [LMS reference code](https://github.com/cisco/hash-sigs). The code is extended by linking it to a TPM and adding an auxiliary data recovery option. In order to communicate with the TPM, code from the [IBM TSS 1.6.0 library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmtpm20tss/) was used. The library is not included in this repository. An example of how to code can be run is seen in test_script.sh.

# Original README
This code attempts to be a usable implementation of the LMS Hash Based
Signature Scheme from RFC 8554.

See read.me for documentation how to use it.

This is the ACVP branch - designed to be (optionally) compatible with the
public ACVP server
